# Review Comments

## Comment for Review1

**Use Meaningful Variable Names**: The variable `d` is not descriptive. It is important to use meaningful and descriptive names for variables to improve code readability and maintainability. Instead of `d`, use a name that clearly indicates its purpose, such as `elapsedTimeInDays`.

**Proper Initialization**: The variable `d` is declared but not initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior.
Fix: Initialize it with a default value (0) to ensure safe usage.

## Comment for Review2

**Use Meaningful Variable Names**: The variable name `dataFromDb` is not descriptive enough. It is important to use meaningful and descriptive names for variables to improve code readability and maintainability. Instead of `dataFromDb`, use a name that clearly indicates its purpose, such as `employeeList`.

**Avoid Redundant Comments**: The comment `// Get List of employees` is redundant because the code should be self-explanatory. If the variable name is descriptive, the comment may not be necessary.

**Explicit Typing**: While `var` can be useful, using explicit types can improve readability, especially for complex types. Consider using `List<Employee>` if the type is known.

Suggested Code Improvement:
```csharp
List<Employee> employeeList = db.GetFromService().ToList();
```
## Comment for Review3:

Avoid Hungarian Notation: The variable names iCounter, strFullName, and dModifiedDate use Hungarian notation, which is not recommended in modern C# coding practices. Instead, use descriptive names without type prefixes.

Use Meaningful Variable Names: Ensure that variable names are meaningful and descriptive. For example, counter, fullName, and modifiedDate are more readable and self-explanatory.

Consistent Naming Conventions: Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase. Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters.

Suggested Code Improvement:

```csharp
int counter;
string fullName;
DateTime modifiedDate;
```

## Comment for Review4:

Method Naming: The method name is clear, but consider making it more descriptive if additional conditions are checked (e.g., IsShopOpenForTransaction).

Parameter Naming:
pDay: Instead of a generic string, use an enum (e.g., DayOfWeek) to avoid invalid values.
pAmount: Rename it to availableAmount for clarity.

Missing Input Validation: The method should validate pDay (e.g., check for null or empty strings).
Encapsulation of Business Logic: The "some logic" placeholder should be replaced with clearly structured logic (e.g., shop opening hours, minimum purchase requirements).

Use XML Documentation: Add meaningful comments to explain the method's purpose.

Fixed Code with Improvements:
```csharp
/// <summary> 
/// Determines whether the shop is open based on the given day and the available amount.
/// </summary> 
/// <param name="day">The day of the week.</param> 
/// <param name="availableAmount">The available amount for shopping.</param> 
/// <returns>True if the shop is open, otherwise false.</returns> 
public bool IsShopOpen(DayOfWeek day, int availableAmount)
{
    // Validate amount (Assumption: non-negative values are valid)
    if (availableAmount < 0)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Amount cannot be negative", nameof(availableAmount));
    }
    // Define shop opening days
    var closedDays = new HashSet<DayOfWeek> { DayOfWeek.Sunday };
    return !closedDays.Contains(day);
}
```

## Comment for Review 5:

`DAYS_IN_WEEK` follows the correct naming convention for constants (all uppercase with underscores).
`daysInMonth` should be renamed to follow the same convention as `DAYS_IN_WEEK` for consistency.
```csharp
const int DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;
```
 
`Artists` should be renamed to follow camelCase convention.
```csharp
var artists = new List<string> { 'ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles' };
```
 
Use double quotes for string literals in C#.
```csharp
var songs = new List<string> { "Back In Black", "Stairway to Heaven", "Hey Jude" };
```
 
`EraseDatabase` and `Restore_database` should follow PascalCase convention.
```csharp
bool EraseDatabase() {}
bool RestoreDatabase() {}
```
The methods `EraseDatabase` and `RestoreDatabase` are empty. Consider implementing them or adding a comment if they are placeholders.
 
animal should be renamed to follow PascalCase convention.
```csharp
class Animal {}
```

## Comment for Review6:

Use Correct Data Types: The correct type for date and time in C# is DateTime, not Datetime. Ensure the correct type is used.

Use Meaningful Property Names: The property names `sWorkDate` and `modTime` are not very descriptive. Use full, meaningful names to improve readability. For example, `StartWorkingDate` and `ModificationTime`.

Avoid Redundant Comments: The comments `// get set Start Working Date` and `// get set Modification Time` are redundant because the property names should be self-explanatory. If the property names are clear, the comments may not be necessary.

Suggested Code Improvement:
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public DateTime StartWorkingDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime ModificationTime { get; set; }
}
```

## Comment for review 7:

Use Explicit Typing: The variable employeephone is declared with var but not initialized. This makes it unclear what type it is supposed to be. Use explicit typing to improve readability and clarity.

Use Meaningful Variable Names: The variable name employeephone should be more descriptive and follow proper naming conventions. For example, employeePhoneNumber would be more meaningful.

Consistent Naming Conventions: Ensure that method parameter names follow consistent naming conventions. Use camelCase for parameter names. For example, workingDays and workingHours.

Initialize Variables: Ensure that variables are properly initialized to avoid potential runtime errors.

Suggested Code Improvement:

```csharp
string employeePhoneNumber;

public double CalculateSalary(int workingDays, int workingHours)
{
    // some logic
}
```
